### <ins>Problem 3:</ins>
Write and briefly explain the following C++ function:

    *long MaxProduct (string file);*

that accepts an input file containing sequences of integers. Each sequence starts on a new line, may continue on several subsequent lines, contains at most 100 numbers, and ends with the number -999999 (which is not part of the sequence).
The function outputs to the screen the maximum continuous sub-sequence product of up to 3 numbers for each sequence, one output per line. It returns the maximum of all the outputs.
Sample input:
1 2 3 -999999
-5 -2 2 -30 -999999 6 9 -10 1 -999999 -8 -999999
